In the summer of 2022, I bid farewell to my college journey, marking a milestone in my life journey and the commencement of a new chapter.


Graduated from college.

I once found myself lost and anxious, realizing that the so-called honors I received quickly turned into waste paper. 
There's still so much more to do. Life's path is rugged and thus cannot be optimized, so let go and take bold actions~
