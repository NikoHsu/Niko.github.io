Hello! Here is **zhiqiang Hsu (Niko, 许志强)**.

I'm currently a second-year graduate student pursuing my Master's degree at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). I have a strong passion for research in the field of artificial intelligence. My research interests encompass Intelligent Decision-making(Reinforcement Learning), Robotics, Multi-agent Systems and Embodied AI. 

Outside of my academic life, I am an enthusiast of psychology and enjoy hiking, badminton and swimming.

Education
======
09/2022 ~ Present: Master, [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xian.

09/2017 ~ 06/2022: B.Sc. in Control Engineering (Automation), [GuangXi University](https://www.gxu.edu.cn/), Nanning.

- GPA: 3.32  (Rank 5st / 132 in the major)

Project Experience
======
- **Robot indoor autonomous navigation based on reinforcement learning**

![nav](/Niko.github.io/images/PJ_navigation.gif)

- Using the PPO algorithm, achieving autonomous navigation based on purely visual input (**Embodied intelligence**);
- Visual image input includes RGB images and depth images.;
- The simulation environment is sourced from the [igibson](https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/) by Stanford Vision and Learning Lab;
- Through training, the robot can learn to decide whether to navigate around or push obstacles to reach the destination faster in the presence of different types of obstacles.

- **Target Tracking for Vision-based Quadcopters**

![nxpcar](/Niko.github.io/images/PJ_uavtrack.gif)

- Target detection and estimation of target position based on visual sensors;
- Tracking of targets by quadcopter using adaptive control;
- The target detection network and control algorithm are deployed on the Jetson Nano.


- **Intelligent unmanned car**

![nxpcar](/Niko.github.io/images/PJ_nxpcar.gif)

- Based on multiple sensors including cameras and electromagnetic sensors;
- Embedded image and data processing algorithms, automatic line-following and control algorithms;
- Main control circuitry as well as motor drive circuitry;
- Controller built using the NXP K60 MCU;

- **Reinforcement learning for multiple UAVs formation maneuver control**

![uav](/Niko.github.io/images/PJ_UAV2v2.gif)

- Based on the MAPPO algorithm in reinforcement learning;
- Dynamics based on [JSBSIM flight simulator](https://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/);
- Implementing autonomous intelligent decision-making for multiple UAVs;


Preprints
======
- **Approximate Optimal Strategy for Multi-Agent System Pursuit-Evasion Game**

First author, IEEE Systems Journal, Under Review

![mpe](/Niko.github.io/images/PA_PE-game.png)

We proposes an approximate optimal control strategy for nonlinear Multi-Agent System Pursuit-Evasion (MPE) games, enhancing team coordination through a graph-theoretic approach, dynamic target graph algorithm, and solving strategies using Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations, with validation through simulations.
